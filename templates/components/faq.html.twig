                <h2 class="title is-4 mt-3">The Technology Behind Disposable Email Addresses</h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone uses an email address every day for work, business contacts, and personal communication. Almost every app and online service today requires an email address. Many stores, contests, loyalty programs, and websites also ask users to register before accessing content, posting comments, or downloading files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While having an email address is useful, receiving large amounts of spam can be frustrating. Databases from online stores can be hacked, putting your real email at risk. Online activity is never completely private, so protecting your email with a disposable address is the safest approach.
                </p>

                <h2 class="title is-4 mt-3">What is a Disposable Email Address?</h2>
                <p>
                    Disposable email addresses are temporary emails that allow users to sign up for websites and services without revealing their real identity. These addresses can receive emails for a limited time and are automatically deleted afterwards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using a disposable email prevents you from being tied to online abuse or spam. You can receive messages at the temporary address and forward important emails to your real inbox. Once the temporary address is no longer needed, it self-destructs.
                </p>

                <h2 class="title is-4 mt-3">Why Use a Fake Email Address?</h2>
                <p>
                    Many services like Amazon Prime, Hulu, or Netflix offer trial periods. With disposable emails, you can test multiple trials without using your real email. Online retailers often require an email to access promotions, which can result in spam. Temporary emails help avoid these unwanted messages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although disposable emails are sometimes associated with hackers, there are many legitimate reasons to use them:

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Test Your App:</strong> Create temporary accounts to test web apps without exposing your main email or hiring testers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Create Multiple Accounts:</strong> For services like IFTTT or social media, use a disposable email for secondary accounts.
                    </li>

                        <strong>Reduce Spam:</strong> Minimize spam when signing up for forums, discussions, or online forms.

                <h2 class="title is-4 mt-3">How to Use a Disposable Email Address</h2>
                <p>
                    Users can create a temporary email account that forwards messages to their real inbox. If the disposable address is compromised, suspicious emails can be discarded without affecting your main account. This is perfect for testing, signing up for multiple services, or keeping your inbox clean.
                </p>

                <h2 class="title is-4 mt-3">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Using disposable emails protects your identity when participating in online forums, chats, or file-sharing platforms. Keep your real email private, avoid spam, and stay safe with <a href="{{ app.request.server.get('DEFAULT_URI') }}" target="_blank">{{ app.request.server.get('DEFAULT_URI')|domain }}</a>.
